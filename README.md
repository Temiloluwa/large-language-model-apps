# Large Language Model Apps

In this repo, I learn, research, and develop LLM apps for different applications.

## Projects

### 1. [Lingua Trainer](https://github.com/Temiloluwa/lingua_trainer)

Lingua trainer is an assistant for learning new languages.
I am exploring different techniques to develop tasks and challenges that are useful for learning foreign languages.
Lingua trainer can assistant a learner with this tasks to help cement their grasp of the new language.


### 2. [Naija Highlights](https://github.com/Temiloluwa/naija_highlights)

Naija, that's the way locals call Nigeria.
I intend to create digests of Nigerian content to give users a "highlight" of what's happening at the moment in Nigeria.
