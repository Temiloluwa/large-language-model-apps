## Projects

### 1. [Lingua Trainer](https://github.com/Temiloluwa/lingua_trainer)

Lingua trainer is an assistant for learning new languages.
I am exploring different techniques to develop tasks and challenges that are useful for learning foreign languages.
Lingua trainer can assistant a learner with this tasks to help cement their grasp of the new language.

I intend to create digests of Nigerian content to give users a "highlight" of what's happening at the moment in Nigeria.
